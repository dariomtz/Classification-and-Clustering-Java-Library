# Classification and Clustering Java Library
This is a library to use Classification and Clustering Models in Java. It was done as the final project of an Object Oriented Programming class, to ilustrate this paradigm.
Therefore, we are well aware that this library only includes a few classes that implement useful models, and that there is a lot more to these topics than just those models.

## How to use it?
It is a gradle library, you can learn how to build it in [this link](https://guides.gradle.org/building-java-libraries/). It can also be done in your IDE of choice.

Once you build it, you can import the generated .jar file into another project.
